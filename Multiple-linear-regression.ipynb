    " This could indicate an interaction effect on the response.\n",

    " For the example given here there are 6 two-way interactions possible between the variables, 4 possible three-way, and 1 four-way interaction in the full model.\n",
    " \n",
    " Often in practice we fit the full model to check for significant interaction effects.\n",
    " If there are no interactions that are significantly different from zero, we can drop the interaction terms and fit the main effects model to see which of those effects are significant.\n",
    " If interaction effects are significant (important in predicting the behavior of the response) then we will interpret the effects of the model in terms of the interaction.\n",
    " \n",
    "<!--  NOTE: not sure if correction for multiple comparisons is outside the scope here; I would in general not recommend to students that they test all possible interactions unless they had a theoretical reason to, or unless they were doinging something exploratory and then would collect new data to test any interaction found. -->"

    " If there are not too many features, you can also look at all possible models.\n",
    " Typically these models are compared using the AIC (Akaike information criterion) which measures the relative quality of models.\n",
    " Given a set of models, the preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC value.\n",
    " \n",
    "Previously we talked about splitting the data into training and test sets.\n",
    "In statistics, this is not common, and the models are trained with all the data.\n",
    "This is because statistics is generally more interested in the effect of a particular variable *across the entire dataset* than it is about using that variable to make a prediction about a particular datapoint.\n",
    "Because of this, we typically have concerns about how well linear regression will work with new data, i.e. will it have the same $r^2$ for new data or a lower $r^2$?\n",
    "Both forward and backward selection potentially enhance this problem because they tune the model to the data even more closely by removing variables that aren't \"important.\"\n",
    "You should always be very careful with such variable selection methods and their implications for model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- NOTE: sklearn does not seem to support forward/backward https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/937/does-scikit-learn-have-forward-selection-stepwise-regression-algorithm ; what it does support is sufficient different/complicated that it doesn't seem useful to try to introduce it now ; this is an example where the give text would fit R perfectly but be dififcult for python -->"
