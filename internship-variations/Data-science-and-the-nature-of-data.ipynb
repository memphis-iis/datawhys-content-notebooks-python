    "\n",
    "<!-- We've talked about structured vs. unstructured data already, but we haven't gone into detail about how structured data is created. -->\n",
    "Structured data begins with **measurements** of some type of thing in the real world, which we call a **variable**.\n",
    "Let's use the example of height. \n",
    "I may measure 10 people and find that their heights in centimeters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Height |\n",
    "|--------|\n",
    "| 165    |\n",
    "| 188    |\n",
    "| 153    |\n",
    "| 164    |\n",

    "| 163    |\n",
    "| 165    |\n",
    "| 190    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these values (e.g. 165) is a measurement of the variable *height*.\n",
    "We call *height* a variable because its value isn't constant.\n",
    "If everyone in the world were the same height, we wouldn't call height a variable, and we also wouldn't bother measuring it, because we'd know everyone is the same.\n",

    "\n",
    "A nominal variable consists of unordered categories, like *male* or *female* for biological sex.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ordinal variables consist of ordered categories.\n",
    "You can think of it as nominal data but with an ordering from first to last or smallest to largest.\n",
    "A common example of ordinal data are Likert questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(1) Strongly disagree\n",
    "(2) Disagree\n",
    "(3) Neither agree nor disagree\n",
    "(4) Agree\n",
    "(5) Strongly agree\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though these options are numbered 1 to 5, those numbers only indicate which comes before the others, not how \"big\" an option is.\n",

    "A classic example is temperature in Fahrenheit.\n",
    "In degrees Fahrenheit, the difference between 70 and 71 is the same as the difference between 90 and 91 - either case is one degree.\n",
    "The other most important characteristic of interval variables is also the most confusing one, which is that interval variables don't have a meaningful zero value.\n",
    "Degrees Fahrenheit is an example of this because there's nothing special about 0 degrees. \n",
    "0 degrees doesn't mean there's no temperature or no heat energy, it's just an arbitrary point on the scale."

    "Age and height are good examples because 0 age means you have no age, and 0 height means you have no height.\n",
    "The name *ratio* reflects that you can form a ratio with these variables, which means that you can say age 20 is twice as old as age 10.\n",
    "Notice you can't say that about degrees Fahrenheit: 100 degrees is not really twice as hot as 50 degrees, because 0 degrees Fahrenheit doesn't mean \"no temperature.\""

    "## Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "We previously said that structured data begins with measurement of a variable, but we haven't explained what measurement really is.\n",
    "Measurement is, quite simply, the assignment of a value to a variable.\n",
    "In the context of a categorical variable like biological sex, we would say the assignment of *male* or *female* is a measurement.\n",
    "Similarly for height, we would say that 180 cm is a measurement.\n",
    "Notice that in these two examples, the measurement depends closely on type of variable (e.g. nominal or ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "How we measure is tightly connected to how we've defined the variable.\n",
    "This makes sense, because our measurements serve as a way of defining the variable.\n",
    "For some variables, this is more obvious than for other variables.\n",
    "For example, we all know what *length* is. \n",
    "It is a measure of distance that we can see with our eyes, and we can measure it in different units like centimeters or inches.\n",
    "However, some variables are not as obvious, like *justice*.\n",
    "How do we measure *justice*?\n",
    "One way would be to ask people, e.g. to ask them how just or unjust they thought a situation was.\n",
    "There are two problems with this approach.\n",
    "First, different people will tell you different things.\n",
    "Second, you may not really be measuring *justice* when you ask this question; you could end up measuring something else by accident, like people's religious beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about measurement, especially of things we can't directly observe, there are two important properties of measurement that we want, **validity** and **reliability**.\n",
    "The picture below presents a conceptual illustration of these ideas using a target.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Attribution: © Nevit Dilmen -->\n",
    "<!-- https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Reliability_and_validity.svg -->\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply stated, **validity means we are measuring what we intend to measure**.\n",
    "In the images, validity is being \"on target,\" so that our measurements are *centered* on what we are trying to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **reliability means our measurements are consistent**. \n",
    "Our measurements could be consistently wrong, which would make them reliable but not valid (lower left).\n",
    "Ideally, our measurements will be both valid and reliable (lower right).\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to validity and reliability, the most important thing to understand is that **validity is not optional.**\n",
    "If you don't have validity, your variable is wrong - you're not measuring what you think you're measuring.\n",
    "Reliability is optional to a certain extent, but if the reliability is very low, we won't be able to get much information out of the variable."

    "### Dirty data \n",
    "\n",
    "If data is clean, then we don't need to correct it or process it to remove garbage values or correct noisy values.\n",
    "You might expect all data to be clean. \n",
    "However, even carefully collected data can have problems that require correction before it can be used properly.\n",
    "Dirty data is the norm for unplanned data collection, so sorry days is common in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways that data can be dirty, but to make the idea more concrete, let's consider a few examples.\n",
    "Imagine that you are interested in the weather in your backyard, so you put out a battery operated thermometer that records the temperature every hour.\n",
    "You then leave it there for a month.\n",
    "Now imagine that it worked fine for the first two weeks, but since you didn't change the batteries, the measurements for the last two weeks become increasingly unreliable, e.g. reporting up to 10 degrees above or below the actual temperature, until it finally shuts off leaving you with no data for the remaining days.\n",
    "This kind of problem, an **instrument failure** leading to **unreliable measurement**, is actually quite common and can take a lot of planning to avoid.\n",
    "<!-- Another example of dirty data is at the recording stage. \n",
    "Imagine a computer is recording audio data by writing it to the hard disk.\n",
    "If the computer suddenly becomes active with another task (say streaming a video or installing an operating system update) the audio data may \"glitch\". -->\n",
    "\n",
    "While *very* dirty data is usually obvious, it can sometimes be hard to recognize. \n",
    "For this reason, it is important to check your data for problems (e.g. crazy values, like a person being 1 ft tall or 200 years old) and think very seriously about how problems should be corrected.\n",
    "Data cleaning is such a tricky topic that we will delay it until much later in the course - for now we'll just focus on finding problems."
