# Internship variations

The DataWhys Summer Internship in later years had an instructor-led "bootcamp" that preceded the use of the notebooks for self-study. 

The bootcamp materials may be found [here](https://github.com/memphis-iis/datawhys-internship-bootcamp-2025). 
At the risk of oversimplifying, the bootcamp materials essentially take the first three modules and spread them out over the course of multiple days.
This necessitated dropping some notebooks from the internship and modifying existing notebooks.

## Modifications

- `Nature of data` was modified to
    - Remove instructions about the interface
    - Streamline presentation of didactic material
    - Add some data cleaning/data integrity material

- `Plotting` was removed from the internship sequence entirely

- The following advanced topics were removed due to time constraints in later years of the internship:
    - Lasso
    - Gradient boosting
    - SVM
    - Naive Bayes
